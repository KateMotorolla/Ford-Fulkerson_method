<h1>Laboratory work "Ford-Fulkerson algorithm"</h1>
In the process of execution, a console application was developed that allows the user to enter data about the transport network (the load matrix of the graph, back arc matrix and the numbers of the initial and final vertices) and obtain intermediate states of the matrices, as well as the value of the maximum network bandwidth
<hr>
After launching the program for execution, you will be greeted by a menu for selecting input data loading. The user can choose one of two options (manually enter data into the console or enter data from a file). The order of data entry:
<ul>
  <li>The number of vertices in the graph</li>
  <li>The number of the initial vertex</li>
  <li>The number of the end vertex</li>
  <li>The load matrix of the graph</li>
</ul>
File "input" for example as input data from file
